### I. Understanding the Mechanism of Shilajit by Using Network Pharmacology Approach
#### Abstract:
1. Created a pharmacological network of Shilajit (Ayuredic drug) to depict the interaction of bio-actives with molecular targets of cancer using Cytoscape <br/>
2. Performed target identification of the bio-actives of Shilajit to predict which component has the most associations with cancer related diseases and could pose as a potential drug target for cancer treatments

### III. UNESCO Data Analysis
#### Abstract:
1. Provided an integrated data analysis framework for the UNESCO data by:
<br/> a)  Clustering the data based on categories to extract meaningful trends and insights
</br> b) Generating dynamically created trends by finding correlation between policy and development parameters and
between the different categories of data
2. Created a web application using HTML and designed interactive graph data visualizations using D3.js
#### Files:
1. Final Report

### IV. Comparative Gene Expression Analysis
#### Abstract:
Developed a pipeline to conduct the differential gene expression of the RNASeq data - Cisplatin-resistant (GSE122130) and FOLFOX-resistant (GSE128967) tumor samples in patients suffering from Gastric Cancer by using tools like DESEQ2, Salmon and HISAT2 and analyzed the DEGs by using iDEP
